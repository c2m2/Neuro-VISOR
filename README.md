# Neuro-VISOR Multi-Headsets Supported (Beta)
**For a more compreshensive documentation about the software itself, please refer to this [link](https://github.com/c2m2/Neuro-VISOR).**
## Branch Description
The original VR framework used for Neuro-VISOR is implemented using the [Oculus SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/), this approach allows naive support for developing software for Oculus devices using Unity Engine, however, this means the software would not run on devices of other VR vendors. Fortunately, the Unity Engine has a unified plug-in framework named [XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XRPluginArchitecture.html) that enables direct integrations for multiple platforms. Again, this branch is only an attempt to replace the original VR framework with the new XR framework, meaning there are bugs and missing features compared to the original version. It is only an experimental transition.
